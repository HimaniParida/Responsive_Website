            <p class="secSubTag text-small">India holds an important place in the global education industry. India has one of the largest networks of higher education institutions in
            the world. However, there is still a lot of potential for further development in the education system.With ~26.31% of India’s population in the age group of 0-14 
            years, India’s education sector provides numerous opportunities for growth.Learning must prepare students and learners of all ages to find solutions for the challenges of 
            today and the future. Education should be transformative and allow us to make informed decisions and take individual and collective action to change our societies and 
            care for the planet.Education for Sustainable Development is recognized as an integral element of Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 4 on quality education and
            a key enabler of all other SDGs(link is external). As the lead UN agency on ESD, UNESCO is responsible for the coordination of the ESD for 2030 Framework.

            <p class="secSubTag text-small">Education can be thought of as the transmission of the values and accumulated knowledge of a society.In this sense, it is equivalent to what 
            social scientists term socialization or enculturation.Children—whether conceived among New Guinea tribespeople, the Renaissance Florentines, or the middle classes of
            Manhattan—are born without culture.Education is designed to guide them in learning a culture, molding their behaviour in the ways of adulthood, and directing them 
            toward their eventual role in society.In the most primitive cultures, there is often little formal learning—little of what one would ordinarily call school or classes 
            or teachers.Higher education, also called tertiary, third stage, or postsecondary education, is the non-compulsory educational level that follows the completion of 
            a school such as a high school or secondary school. Tertiary education is normally taken to include undergraduate and postgraduate education, as well as vocational education and
